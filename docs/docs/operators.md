# Operators

| Operator     | Description                                                    | Example                    |
|:-------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------|
| +            | Adds the values on either side of the operator together        | 10 + 10                    |
| -            | Subtracts the values on either side of the operator together   | 10 - 10                    |
| *            | Multiplies the values on either side of the operator together  | 10 * 2                     |
| /            | Divides the values on either side of the operator together.    | 10 / 3                     |
| ++ Prefix    | Increments the value of a variable by 1                        | ++x                        |
| \-\- Prefix  | Decrements the value of a variable by 1                        | \-\-x                      |
| %            | Modulo of values on either side of the operator                | 10 % 2                     |
| +=           | Same as +, however its shorthand to assign too                 | x += 10 Same as x = x + 10 |
| -=           | Same as -, however its shorthand to assign too                 | x -= 10 Same as x = x - 10 |
| *=           | Same as *, however its shorthand to assign too                 | x *= 10 Same as x = x * 10 |
| /=           | Same as /, however its shorthand to assign too                 | x /= 10 Same as x = x / 10 |
